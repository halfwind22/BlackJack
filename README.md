# BlackJack

## Java implementation of the game of blackjack

### Currently, supports defeating the dealer by:

* Getting blackjack - first two cards equal 21
* Having final card count greater than dealers without exceeding 21
* Dealer getting bust by exceeding the card count of 21

### TODO

* Add rule based intelligence to take more appropriate decisions while ensuring randomness at the same time
* Start with a chest and then add bets
* Double bet -> double the bet amount and are given one more card
* Split if same value for user on both cards
* Multi-user support
